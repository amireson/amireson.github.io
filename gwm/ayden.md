## MES Research

Aydenâ€™s Masters research explores the transport and accumulation of salt in the prairies intending to further understand mechanisms of wetland pond salinization and the expected salt distribution changes that may occur with climate change. Ayden is using data collected from St. Denis National Wildlife Area from the past several decades to determine likely flow paths of salt in and out of wetland ponds and conditions of groundwater and climate that lead to these occurrences. Further, Ayden will be using a newly developed 2D model to simulate salt transport and accumulation in the prairie landscape to project potential changes expected under a variety of climate change scenarios.
