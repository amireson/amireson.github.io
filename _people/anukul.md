## M.Sc. Research

Water stress is considered a key limiting factor in crop yield and is a challenge for semi-arid, cold-region Prairie agriculture. Existing crop models are mostly limited to simulating crop yield and water balance without taking into account the complex cold-region hydrological processes. Anukul's research aims to simulate cold-region hydrological processes using the MESH, SUMMA and SHAW models for post-snowmelt/ thaw soil conditions and then use the outcome from each model to determine wheat yield using the FAO AquaCrop model for sites in Saskatchewan. Anukul will seek to explain the differences between outcomes from the three hydrological-crop model combinations and provide recommendations based on consistency with field observations.
