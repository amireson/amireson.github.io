## PhD Research

Alana's PhD research is based at Baker Creek, located on treaty 11 territory, and focuses on quantfying hydrological processes associated with thawing permafrost, using combined field observations and mdoelling. Under a warming climate, as permafrost thaws, the subsurface flow pathways are expected to change. Thawing will lead to thickening of the active layer, the expansion of taliks and enhanced groundwater discharge and export of dissolved carbon from uplands into wetlands and streams.
