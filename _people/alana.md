## PhD Research

Alanaâ€™s PhD research focuses on understanding how water movement and soil moisture heterogeneity across a hillslope influences active layer thaw and permafrost degradation. Her work is based on field investigations from Baker Creek, NWT where soil moisture, ground temperatures and hydrological fluxes are monitored. This work aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of permafrost thaw in diverse landscapes to assist in model predictions of future hydrological and biogeochemical processes.
