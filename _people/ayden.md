## MES Research

Ayden's MES research focuses on understanding the drivers of soil and wetland salinization in the Canadian prairies. His field site is St Denis SK, where he is monitoring pond and soil salinity. He will develop coupled flow and solute transport models to predict how changes in climating drivers, changes in the water table and changes in land use may impact salinization.
