## MES Research

Geological weighing lysimeters (GWL) provide a means to quantify the total water storage change at scales of the order 1000-10000m<sup>2</sup>, by measuring the changes in mechanical loading within an aquitard or confined aquifer. Morgan's research combines observations from a GWL with shallow soil moisture, snow water equivalent and the shallow water table, to partition total storage into components of shallow groundwater, soil moisture, surface water and snow. Morgan is applying the MESH and SUMMA models to reproduce field observations.
