Seth maintains our field site at St Denis, SK, where we monitor soil moisture, frozen soils, evaporation fluxes, precipitation, groundwater levels, pond levels and chemistry. St Denis has been running since 1967, and has a long term, high quality record of hydrological change in the prairie pothole region. See an overview of the site [here](https://youtu.be/1sfTyNj4ZJM)

Seth formerly completed an MES, looking at the role of solutes on the soil freezing characteristic curve. See his publication on this work here: [Amankwah, S. K., Ireson, A. M., Maul√©, C., Brannen, R., & Mathias, S. A. (2021) A Model for the Soil Freezing Characteristic Curve That Represents the Dominant Role of Salt Exclusion.
