## PhD Research

Ines' PhD focuses on quantifying the fate of snowmelt over frozen soils. Snowmelt is the dominant hydrological flux in many seasonally frozen areas, and at the time of melt, the soils remain frozen. The distribution of ice and liquid water in the soil pore space determines the infilitration capacity of the soils. Consequently, the same SWE can result in markedly different outcomes in any given year, depending on the state of the soil. When soils are wet and frozen, large amounts of runoff can be generating, sometimes resulting in floods. When soils are dry and frozen, water can infiltrate into air-filled pores, and most snowmelt infiltrates, recharging the soils and groundwater. Ines is exploring field observations and testing numerical models to improve our understanding of these processes.
