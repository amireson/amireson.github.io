## PhD Positions: Hydrology-Carbon interactions in thawing Permafrost

The <a href="http://water.usask.ca">Global Institute for Water Security</a> is working with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a> to develop tools for assessing water quality and climate impacts on prairie and northern rivers. Under this project, we are seeking two PhD students to work on Climate Change impacts on permafrost in the North West Territories. 

The projects will be based at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UoH8wCcpSRJJuicR6">Baker Creek</a>. The students will conduct field work during the spring-summer months to observe changes in the permafrost, soil and groundwater, streamflows and export of C. Both students will work in a team that includes Andrew Ireson, Colin Whitfield, Chris Spence, Barrie Bonsal, Helen Baulch, Martyn Clark, Diogo Da Costa and Karl Lindenschmidt. The students will also work collaboratively on a model for carbon export from permafrost landscapes on the Canadian Shield. One project will focus primarily on the hydrological processes, and will combine field observations with models. Under a warming climate, as permafrost thaws, the subsurface flow pathways are expected to change, as depicted in the diagram below showing our hypothesis for how the system will change. Thawing will lead thickening of the active layer, the development of taliqs and enhanced groundwater discharge and export of dissolved carbon from uplands into wetlands and streams. The student that undertakes this project will have excellent understanding of hydrological processes, excellent mathematical modelling skills and will have, or develop, excellent computational skills.

The other project will focus primarily on the carbon processes. This project will be supervised by Dr Colin Whitfield and Dr Chris Spence. In this project, field work will be undertaken to quantify the stores and fluxes of carbon in the soils, groundwater, wetlands and streams. The release of CO2 and methane (CH4) from thawing permafrost landscapes is a huge potential source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. This project will study the mechanisms of carbon releases and how these are coupled to the hydrological processes. The student that undertakes this project will have an excellent background in biogeochemisty, and good understanding of hydrology and will have, or develop, excellent computational skills.

Each PhD is fully funded and available immediately. The students will be based in Saskatoon within the Global Institute for Water Security, the leading center for water resources research in Canada. Portions of the work will be carried out in at Baker Creek. There can also be options to work remotely for parts of the program when coursework has been completed. The students will also be members of Dr Ireson and Dr Whitfield lab groups, and engage with other students working in these groups. The students will also work closely with Environment and Climate Change Canada, and gain experience of that organization.
