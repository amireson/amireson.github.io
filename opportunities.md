## PhD Positions: Hydrology-Carbon interactions in thawing Permafrost

The <a href="http://water.usask.ca">Global Institute for Water Security</a> is working with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a> to develop tools for "Water quality and climate impacts of prairie and northern rivers". Under this project, we are seeking two PhD students to work on Climate Change impacts on permafrost in the North West Territories. 

The projects will be based at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UoH8wCcpSRJJuicR6">Baker Creek</a>. The students will conduct field work during the spring-summer months to observe changes in the permafrost, soil and groundwater, streamflows and export of C.

One project will focus primarily on the hydrological processes, and will combine field observations with models. Under a warming climate, as permafrost thaws, the subsurface flow pathways are expected to change, leading to enhanced groundwater discharge, leading in turn to enhanced export of carbon from uplands into wetlands and streams. The active layer - the portion of the soil that thaws each year 
This project will be supervised by Dr Andrew Ireson, and Dr Chris Spence.

The other project will focus primarily on the carbon processes. This project will be supervised by Dr Colin Whitfield and Dr Chris Spence.
