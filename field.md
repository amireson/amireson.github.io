# Field data: Uri's transect at St Denis

These animations show how the water table and frost table (i.e. depth of the zero degree isotherm) varies over Uri's transect with time, for each of the hydrological years.

Red and blue lines are hydraulic heads measured by the shallow (4 m) and deep (6 m) piezometers, respectively. The cyan area is the soil zero degree isotherm, measured by the Hydra probes.
